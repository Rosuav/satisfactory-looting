//Read a text (non-ironman) EU4 savefile and scan for matters of interest. Provides info via a web page.
/*
NOTE: Province group selection inverts the normal rules and has the web client in charge.
This ensures that there can be no desynchronization between user view and province ID
selection, but it does mean that the client must remain active in order to keep things
synchronized. In practice, not a problem, since the client selects the group anyway.
*/
//TODO: Background service to do the key sending. See example systemd script in my cfgsystemd.

/* TODO: Support mods better.
Current: Preload on startup, cache the last-used-mod-list in eu4_parse.json, and if the save
doesn't have the same set, warn. The localisation files will probably be wrong.
Better fix: Isolate all the global state from the socket connections and, instead of dying, keep
the sockets and reload all the definitions. Might also allow connections earlier, fwiw.

May end up switching all definition loading to parse_config_dir even if there's normally only the
one file, since it makes mod handling easier. Will need to handle a replace_path block in the mod
definition, possibly also a dependencies block. See: https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Mod_structure

It may be of value to have multiple L10n caches, since mod switching is costly at the moment.
It may also be of value to have a way to recognize a change to a mod, to force a reload.

If there are any issues remaining - notably, if anything crashes - report it on the client. Once
that and the above are all done, the server can become purely a service, no console needed.
